== Acquisition ==
* The USGS contracted the USACE's JALBTCX
* Acquired in December 3rd to 6th 2006 -- 20061203 to 20061206
* Acquired with a Leica ALS50-II system

=== QA/QC of xzy points ===
* The RMSE < 15cm which equation to a _vertical uncertainty_ = ± 30cm at 95% confidence interval
* The lidar system produces data with a horizontal _uncertainty_ of $7 - 64cm$ and a vertical _uncertainty_ of $8 - 24cm$

==== Cleaned data ====
* The cleaned data has no-data assigned to cells with an average elevation < 0.37m NAVD88 (MHW)
* area < 500 m² were set to no-data
* Edited lidar data doesn't include any points which fell above the ground surface (vegetation, buildings, and other obstructions)
	- I imagine this means the last return data, but this is how its describe in the documents
* Filtered and edited lidar data are compared with ground control points (GCP) by sampling all lidar data within 1m of the GCP
	- If a tree was present at the GCP, then a 3m radius was selected
