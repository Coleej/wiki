Discussion of geologic framework of the LA coastal zone. It looks broadly at the geology of the GOM and closer at nearshore surficial geology of LA.

= Notes =
* There is an interesting map (Fig. 11, p.66) of the surficial sediment type at the Caminada Headlands.
	- Nearshore is mostly sand, which grades into silty sand
	- Near the divergence point, there is a sand wedge which extends further offshore than the rest of the Caminada Headlands
	- There appears to be a very extensive ebb tidal delta at Barataria Pass
