== General ==
* Simulates a physical model experiment, which doesn't generate [[IG waves]] at the boundary (1st-order wave steering), both with and without [[IG waves|IG wave]] generation. Finds that with [[IG waves|IG wave]] generation (2nd-order wave steering) the simulation results are not as good.
	- Stresses the importance of this for physical modelers. If they want to recreate realistic conditions they may need 2nd-order wave steering.
* Simulates the shoaling of [[IG waves]]
