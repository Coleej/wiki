== Shore definitions ==
* See diagram [[file:images/stockdon_shore_defs.png|here]]
* Shoreline position ($x_{sl}$) is determined by the intersection of MHW (for the area) and the lidar data
	- MHW = 0.37m NAVD88 for Caminada at this time
	- A probabilistic method which accounts for the RMSE of the interpolation is considered during this process
