= Metadata =
== Acquisition ==
* Survey date: 2010-04-09 through 2010-04-26

== Raw lidar ==
== QA/QC ==
δx = ±0.5m
δy = ±0.15m

== Las points ==
=== CRS ===
* UTM 15n
* NAD83
* GRS80
* NAVD88 (GEOID12B)
	* 0.01m altitude resolution


== Rasters ==
Δx = 1m


= Analysis =
== Morphology change between 2008 - 2010 ==
=== Import ===
1. Downloaded raster files from USGS
2. projected to utm15n with a resolution of 2m and using lanczos_f interpolation

=== Extract dune area ===
* This removes water surfaces and small areas
	1. remove all cells with elevation less than 0.297m (GI MHW NAVD88)
	2. remove all areas except the 5 major continous areas that constitute the coastline dune/beach areas
