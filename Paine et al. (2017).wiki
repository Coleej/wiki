== General ==
* "Two critical parameters that increase the erosion potential of a tropical cyclone are surge height and surge duration: the longer sea level is elevated above normal during storm passage, the greater the potential for redistribution of sediment eroded from the beach. (p.490)"

== Methods ==
=== Forcing description ===
* The entire shoreline of TX was analyzed with lidar surveys between 2010 - 2012
* Table of all tropical storms on the record which made landfall in TX (p.491)
	- time period
	- landfall location

=== Lidar ===
* 3 surveys (2010, 2011, 2012)
* Described the lidar sampling equipment and other details

==== Ground truthing ====
* Ground GPS surveys of roads and other open areas with unambiguous surfaces were shot
* lidar points with 0.5m of GPS points (no number is given) were differenced and the average difference for a survey was used to correct the lidar for bias
	- residuals:
		* 2010 survey: -0.18m to +0.07m
		* 2011 survey: -0.21m to +0.22m
		* 2012 survey: -0.15m to +0.23m
* differences between local MSL and NAVD88 datum are given (15cm to 1cm)

=== Morphology ===
* DTMs were contoured at a certain elevation (unspecified) to produce shoreline proxies which were compared to historical shoreline erosion rates
* DTMs were contoured at 1-m intervals and the area of these level surfaces were used:
	1. to determine geomorphic features
	2. estimate subaerial sand storage
	3. determine erosional resistance
	4. storm flooding susceptibility
