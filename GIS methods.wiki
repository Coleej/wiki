= Rasters =
== GRASS ==
* _nearest neighbor resampling_: Calculates the center of the *region*'s cell and takes the value of the raster cell into which is falls

= Vectors =
== GRASS ==
* A topological GIS
	* topological data is referred to as level 2 data
	* [[spaghetti_GIS_data|spaghetti data]] is referred to as level 1 data
* Layers allow for thematically distinct but topologically related data to be worked on (e.g time-series data for a location which didn't change)
	
=== Miscellaneous ===
* Many operations (extraction, query,...) will only function on features assigned a category number
	- It seems that *categories* in [[GRASS]] are similar to *attributes* in [[QGIS]] but are part of the geometry file (can also be part of the attribute table)
* Many operations require a topology (i.e. the vector data is level 2)

= Workflows =
== Compare elevation by point ==
1. Get hub distance between 2 surveys in time
2. Extract points where hub distances is less than 2 m
3. Join surveys based on the point IDs of the points resulting from #2
4. Field calculate the difference between elevations in the attribute table of #3

== Compare elevation by raster ==
=== Beginning with point data ===
1. Compute concave hull of point vector shape
2. Set mask with the hull shape from #1
3. Interpolate point data to raster
	* v.surf.idw doesn't allow setting a mask
	* v.surf.rst allows a mask
		- Using the 2013 design survey of Caminada with default params ($Δx = 2m$) the RMSD ≈ 0.35m
		- Should try to consider the anisotropy of beach data

== Determining shorelines ==
* It seems that the most common technique is to assume a shoreline datum and remove all the points seaward of this ([[Stockdon et al. (2012)]])
