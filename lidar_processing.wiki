= Acquisition =

= Offset correction =
	* lidar were shifted according to systematic biases determined from residuals calculated from GC points along Chevron rd. shot during [[2012 post-Isaac survey]]
	* The shifts were taken as the mean residual and corrected for VLM observed at the GI tide station

		- [[file:~//Projects/10_caminada_lidar/10_lidar_offset_correction/2nd_attempt_geoid12b/offset_VLMs_corr.csv|VLM corrections]]

= Classification =
	* The surveys following surveys were classified with the [[lidar_classification#MCC|MCC]] algorithm. The other surveys were already classified
		- [[1998_ALACE_lidar|1998 NOAA/USGS/NASA ALACE lidar]]
		- [[2001_USGS_lidar|2001 USGS lidar]]
		- [[2002_ALACE_lidar|2002 NOAA/USGS/NASA ALACE lidar]]
		- [[2008_post_Gustav_lidar|September 2008 USGS post-Gustav lidar]]

= Interpolation =
	* The shifted and classified base-ground lidar were analyzed for quality (point density, elevation variance per cell) at a different resolutions
		- [[file:data/lidar_stats_entire_region.csv|lidar stats]]
	*  were interpolated with RST interpolation to 0.5m resolution DTMs.
		- cross-validation (cv) optimization results can be found here: [[file:data/cv_results|cv results]]

= Masking =
	1. If lidar didn't have a return within a 10 m cell, then this area was masked out
	2. Cells below MHW for the year of the survey were masked out
		- See [[file:~/Projects/10_caminada_lidar/40_lidar_analysis_central_subregion/MHW_estimates_7mmperyr_subsidence.csv|MHW estimates]] for values used
		- Determined from linear regression of GI tide gauge with 7mm of subsidence removed
