= Classification =
	* The surveys following surveys were classified with the [[lidar_classification#MCC|MCC]] algorithm. The other surveys were already classified
		- [[1998_ALACE_lidar|1998 NOAA/USGS/NASA ALACE lidar]]
		- [[2001_USGS_lidar|2001 USGS lidar]]

= Masking =
	1. If lidar didn't have a return within a 10 m cell, then this area was masked out
	2. Cells below MHW for the year of the survey were masked out
		- See [[file:~/Projects/10_caminada_lidar/40_lidar_analysis_central_subregion/MHW_estimates_7mmperyr_subsidence.csv|MHW estimates]] for values used
		- Determined from linear regression of GI tide gauge with 7mm of subsidence removed
