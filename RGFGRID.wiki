= Operations =
== Navigation ==
* To exit a given mode (point, spline, poly, etc) and enter a one, the appropriate ctrl-alt-<key> must be pressed

== Edit point ==
=== Move point with neighbors ===
* The area of influence is always 1/6 of visual area

== Block ==


== Polygon ==
* polygons are self-closing

== Paste grid ==
* Only two grids can be loaded at once
* Perpendicular to the line of intersection, the grids should be similar
	- No refinements allowed
* Grid points should be close to each other


= Notes =
== General ==
* Use *refine mesh locally* and *line smooth* together to produce smooth local refinements
	1. Use *block refine* on the entire grid
	2. *Orthogonalize* the entire grid

* The _error_ in the direction in the pressure gradient in Delft3D-FLOW (NLSW equations) is proportional to the *orthogonality* (cell centered cosign of the intersecting cell boundaries) of the cells
	- The center of the model should have $0.02 - 0.04$ for orthogonality scores

* The *M-* and *N-smoothness* compares the adjacent cell areas and returns the ratio of the larger to the smaller
	- The grid should be *smooth* to minimize truncation errors in the FD scheme
	- Should be less than 1.2 in the area of interest, but local exceptions may be acceptable

== Multi-domain grids (nested domains) ==
* No gaps or overlaps between sub-domains
* transverse lines from course to refined domains should be continued
	- Refinement should be 1-to-N, where N is the grid refinement factor in the nested domain

== Controls ==
*undo* = Esc-Esc-Esc
