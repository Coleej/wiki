* the Superdome is about 4.5 million ydÂ³
* Clayton Brilland worked on the Ship Shoal borrow site for the Cam restoration
* average 1 dollar per yard per mile for restoration but Caminada was ~30 dollars
* Cam erodes 3km/100 year historically
* *Shifted data sets for subsidence when calculating erosion rates for Cam (1880 - 2006)*
	* A static shift of 7mm was applied to the whole area
	* Used tidal gauge at Grand Isle to determine the shift of the bathymetric data
* Steeping of section of Cam behind breakwater post-1970 was attributed to breakwaters and shoreline hardening
* During the transgressive stage, the opening up to the inlets and increase in tidal prism, increasing amounts of sediment are lost to ebb tidal deltas
* sub-aerial area is used to evaluate the value of coastal restoration projects
* Ship Shoal has much higher quality sand (coarser grain size and less mud)
	- Is this different from the native sand at Cam?
	- How does this affect the sediment mobility during a hurricane
* Dr. Davin Wallace
	- Mississippi Offshore Sediment Resources Inventory: Late Quaternary Stratigraphic Evolution of the Inner Shelf
* R. Caffey, D. Petrolia and I. Georgiou
	* Economics and geomorphic comparison of nearshore vs. OCS sand from coastal restoration projects
	* D3D results show that placing the borrow pits in the offshore is more valuable to restoration projects than making nearshore cuts (these affect wave energy)
* "the models" say that the renourishment lasts about 25 years before renourishment need to restore the foot print and shoreline position

* Used to be to move the shoal and ebb-tidal delta sediment to the subaerial portions of the barrier headlands
