* GoM component wind fields are identical (GU_n02b_95{x,y}.wnd) in all cases
	- Delft3D/asm/GU_n02b_95x.wnd - May 16 2014
	- Delft3D/typhoon/t101to150/t112_n02b_4081/GU_n02b_95x.wnd - March 18 2015
	- Delft3D/typhoon/t101to150/t111_n02b_4085hu/GU_n02b_95y.wnd - March 18 2015

* There is only one regional flow wind file on the computational grid
	- Delft3D/asm/mesh14/GU_mesh14_95.wnd - Nov. 25 2014
		* *Seems too old to cover Ke's extension?*
		* Seems to be used by all the *.mdf files

* There is only one set of component wind files for the curvilinear grid
	- Delft3D/asm/mesh14/GU_mesh14_95y.wnd - Nov. 18 2014

* there are many files for hurricane_mesh14.*, but they all seem identical
	- the mesh14_08_c.dep is identical

* there are many files for new02b.*, but they all seem identical

* there is only one mesh14_fri07.rgh

* There are 4 initial condition files (test5_082800.ini). Three of them are identical and more recent
	* Delft3D/typhoon/t149_bay_ocean/test5_082800.ini - Aug. 29 2015
	* others - Oct. 24 2015

* There are few versions of veg*_def and multiple files for the one specified in the mdf. The one used seems to be the most recent
	* Delft3D/typhoon/t152_r02_sav/veg2007_def - Feb 26 2016



== Un-categorized files ==
=== typhoon/Input/README.txt ===
* Contains the paths and partial descriptions for Ke's model inputs:
	- boundary conditions (.bnd and .bct files)
	- observation files (.obs files)
	- structure files (.thd, .lwl, and .veg files)
	- initial sediment thickness (.dep)
	- initial flow conditions

=== Dell_m4800/README.txt ===
* Contains a description of highest level directories

== Directories ==
== typhoon/t* ==
* these are individual numerical experiments and tests for the 2D model
* each directory contains the .mdf and .mdw files for the run
* each directory contains a README.txt which explains the purpose of the experiment

== typhoon/run3d/ ==
* contains directories with individual 3D models

= Model setup =
== General ==
A 2D depth averaged model

== Grids ==
=== Gulf of Mexico (GoM) mesh ===
==== Resolution ====
* Δx ≈ [50km, 10km] from the Atlantic to LA coast, respectfully

=== LA mesh ===
==== Resolution ====
* Δx ≈ [1km - 3km] near continental shelf
* Δx ≈ [200m - 300m] near coastal wetlands
* Δx ≈ [60m - 80m] near across the Mississippi River

== Wind ==
* Kelin's parametric model was used to generate the wind field
* The National Hurricane Center's best tract was used and merged with the large-scale background winds provided by National Center for Environmental Protection
* $RMSE = 2.6 \frac{m}{s}$ for all stations with $R^2 = 0.92$

== Vegetation ==
* Vegetation cover maps provided by [[USGS]] 2007 coastal wide map
* Vegetation properties were taken from the USDA Natural Resources Conservation herbaceous plant online database and other literature
* The vegetation induced drag was separated from the bottom friction in the flow model to eliminate unrealistic bottom shear stresses in the sediment transport model
* Vegetation induced wave height reduction was calculated with the [[Madsen et al. (1988)]] which relates the roughness length to Manning's _n_ and local water depth
	* The Manning's _n_ was spatially variable and computed from the mapped vegetation properties
	* The roughness length was updated at each [[SWAN]] time step from the computed water level in the flow model

== D-WAVE ==
=== Physics ===
* A $1 \frac{m}{s}$ North wind is uniformly applied (why?)
	* Forces quadruplet interactions to be turned on
* Bottom friction is set to [[Madsen et al. (1988)]] with a value lower than the default: 0.002m
	* the default is 0.05m

=== Numerics ===
* The necessary coverage of wet grid points was lowered from 98% (default) to 95%

=== Output parameters ===
* the wave computation time-set is 60 min (default = 5 min)

=== Coupling ===
* Ke Liu used the default _dioconfig.ini_ file
