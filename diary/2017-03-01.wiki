== TODO ==
* [X] find out who is coming from Dr. J's lab
	- Kelin and Ling will come on Sunday
* [X] ask Dr. Chen about sediment traps near the HOBOs
	- Yes, put these near instrument transects and interior HOBOs
	- Put these by the PBC pipes.
	- Sediment traps to get the suspended sediment near the instrumentation. They have to be able to capture the sediment near.
* [X] Find out about RTK Trimble and its operator
	- [X] Email C4G
* [X] Email personnel list to Dr. Xu and make sure Dr. Hagen is copied

* See Dr. Chen's drawing for configuration of sensors at M1.
* Use base plates for HOBOs
* Measure vegetation properties at three cross shore locations
	- See Dr. C's scheme for the locations
	- Stem diameter, density, and height
		- See diagram for the definitions of these parameters
	- Use the 0.5x0.5m quadrant count the stem density and cut a representative amount of stems (15 per plot) for measurement in the lab.
	- Set up vegetation sampling kits for Ling and Kelin
* See what Giancarlo's plan with surveying is.
