== Observation points ==
* Observation points are not in world coordinates, but rather in grid coordinates.
* Look at the boundary file *.ldb 
  - This is defined in world coorindates
  - Load it into the GUI as land boundary file
  - Use the GUI cursor to get the newly displayed points in grid coordinates

== Argument file ==
* Change the .mdf file in the .xml file (eg config_d_hydro.xml)
	* *Only change the .mdf file*

== dioconfig.ini ==
* make sure that this is in $D3D_HOME

== Fully coupled runs ==
* make sure you change the *.mdw file in the PBS script
* Make sure to use a "1" with the wave.exe to indicate "loosely coupled"
