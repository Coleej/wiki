= Notes =
== General ==
* Continue with XBeach modeling and lidar analysis
* Make sure to document lidar analysis

== Lidar analysis ==
* Dr. Chen supports turning the MCC optimization into a paper
	- Suggests contacting the USGS St. Pete office about co-authoring this paper
	- Suggests expanding the region of analysis, but not to the entire domain at the moment
	- Make the new region somewhere which will allow for an XBeach model domain and analysis
	- Make sure to document lidar analysis
* Speak to Feng Chen about paralleling the MCC algorithm
	- Split domain into tiles for computation

== XBeach ==
* Make new domain the in the interior of Caminada in order to cut out the effects of the inlets
* Expect to do multiple runs for the small area until the results are reasonable and well understood
* In the future, the domain will be expanded to the inlets

== General Exam ==
* Need to show XBeach results
* Get proposal for RESTORE ACT from Dr. Chen to develop work plan

== Structure of Dissertation ==
