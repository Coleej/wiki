== Notes ==
	* Delay the deployment
	* Deploy ADV in upward looking orientation.
		- Bury it in the ground
	* Use model to get flux on the marsh surface
	* Deploy sediment traps during cold front to calibrate sediment transport
	* One of Dr. Chen's wave gauge's has 13% error, the rest are already committed
	* One of KX's wave gauges is valid up to 30m, but the error for this device might be greater than the waves

== TODO ==
	1. [ ] Look at HOBOs
	2. [ ] Look at the broken wave gauge
		- Contact Tom to figure out the atmospheric pressure background
	3. [ ] Check out the Sontek
	4. [ ] Pull out baseplate and work with Jiaza
	5. [ ] Pull out one staff gauge
