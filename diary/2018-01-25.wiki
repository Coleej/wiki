== General ==
* Is the continuity equation the same as the conservation of mass?
* The dimension of a particular momentum eq'n is termed the _streamwise_ direction
* Numerical models solve momentum and con't eq'ns and the turbulent stresses need to be closed with different turbulence models

== Non-linearity ==
* Ozdemir's definition of non-linearity:
	- Linearity in differential equations is different from the functional definition
	- A rule of thumb: if there is curvature, then it is non-linear
* Local acceleration, viscous, and pressure terms are linear
* The convective acceleration is non-linear <- *source of turbulence*

== Turbulence ==
* The Reynolds' limits for turbulent flow were affected by a railroad near his lab
* After the Reynolds' decomposition, the standard deviation and variance of the fluctuations gives a measure of turbulence
* Turbulence is inherently 3D
	- So, even for a 1D pipe flow, as soon as it enters a turbulence regime the flow is 3D
* After averaging the Reynolds' decomposition the only extra term remaining is the *Reynolds' stress*
	- The Reynolds' stress is not always characterizable
	- There are normal and shear Reynolds' stresses
* In order to account for skewness in the fluctuations in the turbulent flow, one must proceed to the *turbulent kinetic energy* eq'n
	* A production term appears which is affected by the *Reynolds' stress* and shear
