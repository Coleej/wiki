= Notes =
* Do not consider lake Campaign right now. Do not want to  get bogged down in the details
* Assume reasonable elevation values for the active breaches based on literature

= TODO =
1. [X] Research the literature for depths in the breach channels
2. [X] Find average time step
3. [X] Get map of interpolation errors for the Caminada offshore area
