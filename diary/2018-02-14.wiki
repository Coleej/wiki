= Notes =
* Dr. Chen is satisfied with the analysis of the Caminada dune data once the volume change is complete
	- He suggests one value of dune toe elevation
	- This should be based on alongshore averaging the dune profiles and determining the point of maximum curvature
* Dr. Chen want to include forcing in some regard. His main ideas are
	1. Separate dune change into the episodic portion and the background rates
	2. Water levels compared to dune crest elevation is the primary control factor
		* Get water levels for the events from CERA right at Caminada
		* Compute freeboard for each transect and relate this to change
* Rates of movement should be compared to the forcing within the separation between episodic vs regular forcing
	- Look at movement rates for $D_{high,x}$ given prior $D_{high,z}$
	- Look at volume change given freeboard
* Plot dune crest elevation change versus spatial relationships to hurricanes (track info) and also incorporate the wind fields
