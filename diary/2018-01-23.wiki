= Notes =
* _scale variabily_: Do processes transfer from one scale to another (e.g. meso- to micro-scale)
	- Ozdemir thinks this is one of the biggest problems we are facing
* turbulence = chaotic.
	- Admits to average quantification over time
	- Due to nonlinearity in the processes
* Turbulent mixing is much faster than diffusion

== Momentum eq'n ==
* the pressure term is often given as a general placeholder for the driving force
* In order to have diffusion, the flow must be representable as a 2-nd order eq'n
