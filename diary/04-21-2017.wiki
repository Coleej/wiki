	== Field Work Update ==
		=== Giancarlo ===
		* Attempted to take 10 20' cores at TE
		=== Karim ===
		* Gathered 170 RTK points at the "crab claw"
		=== 26 hr survey ===
		* 4-28-2017 for ISCO deployment
		* The sensors will be collected at later date
	
	== Agenda ==
	* There is a special session at Fall AGU on CoastalSEES for geomorphodynamics
	
	== Updates ==
		=== Kelin Hu ===
			==== Water level ====
			* KX says that the tripod was possibly moved that would explain the shifting of the water level upward.
			* SH thought that it might be a subtidal signal, but that has already been corrected.
			==== Currents ====
			* The peaks are missed at T1
			* The observation point ($z = h - 27$ cm) is interpolated from the [[Delft3D]] results which are in
				- The data are the 20 min average
				- Get the processed de-spiked
				- In general, 4-league bay is well mixed when the $u > 5$ m/s
			* What is the cause of the error at T2?
				- KX: It could be very shallow water.
				- JW uses T1 because the ADV is more reliable (ADV Ocean)
			==== Sediments ====
			* settling velocity 0.1 mm/s is ok preliminary value by KX's opinion
			* The model-observed offset of 0.2 g/l is the concentration in the river (SB and KX), so this offset is due to not including river yet.
			==== New Bathymetry ====
			* Need to start working with the new data set.
		=== Chris S. ===
		* Developing tools to process model output for social analysis.
		* Production system for storm runs.
		=== Nina L. ===
		* 1100 phone survey results ready to analyze
		=== Doug E. ===
		* Published the remote sensing analysis in GRL
		* Trying to analyze the processes responsible for land loss (e.g. wind waves vs vegetation dye-off)
