== BBL Turbulence in steady flows ==
* Define a velocity scale: the shear velocity ($u_*$)
	* $u_* = \sqrt{\frac{\tau}{\rho}}$
	* connects the length and the time scale
* In the non-dimensional laminar velocity profile very close to the wall, the profile becomes linear
* Viscosity dominates near the wall.
* The turbulent flows change the velocity profile and a Reynolds' stress appears on the left
	* this term eventually vanishes after integration over the control volume denoting the redistribution of momentum

== Law of the Wall ==
* viscous length scale: $\frac{\nu}{u_*}$
* Even in turbulent flow, very near the wall the velocity profile is linearly dependent on distance form the wall
	* This is the viscous sub-later ($u_+ = z_+$, $z_+ <$)
	* Buffer layer: $5 < z_+ < 30$
		* See an explosive growth in turbulence (growth of the turbulent production term)
	* log layer: turbulence is developed here
	* Transitions into the outer layer where turbulence is fully developed
