= General Notes =
* It is possible to combine curvilinear and unstructured meshes in D3D.
	- Must be done manual ATM
	- Time consuming
* "Moving to flexible mesh" webinar (Deltares)
* If there is a small gap between adjacent meshes, its not difficult to automatically generate a connecting triangular mesh.
	- This depends on connecting cell geometry
	- Triangles are easy, but quadrilateral with "T-junctions"
	- D3D can use combined triangular and curvilinear meshes, but they prefer curvilinear grids for speed and accuracy.
* Triangular mesh for Kelin's model of upper Breton sound is arguably necessary because of land form geometry.

= TODO =
* [x] Compile full list of data
	- Hydro, morpho
* [x] What does XBeach need from D3D
	- Compile list
	- Work out how this fit in with Kelin's work flow
