= Notes =
== General ==

== Reynolds stress ==
* This changes the mixing and the vertical velocity profile compared to laminar flow
* This figures as a sink to the pressure gradient term

== Kinetic energy equation ==
* Large K denotes mean KE and small k denotes turbulent KE
* Derive the mean KE equation with the product of the momentum eq'n and the mean velocity and likewise for the turbulent KE eq'n (TKE)

=== Mean KE budget ===
* The vorticity transports energy from the mean flow to the TKE budget
* The Reynolds stress energy term is always negative (explanation forthcoming) and forms the *turbulence production term* in the TKE budget

== Turbulence generation ==
* Roughness in the pipe gives rise to the fluctuations
* Ideally smooth surfaces may still have turbulence due to _impurities_ within the flow (temp., sediment)

== Turbulence dissipation ==
* Viscosity is a cause of turbulence dissipation (as seen in the dissipation term in the TKE budget)
* The kinematic viscosity between the MKE and TKE budget are identical, but the shear terms will be different
* In the eddy spectrum energy cascade, the energy containing eddies range are the formations directly taking energy from the mean flow and transfers it to viscous dissipation
	- the energy cascade is used to check numerical simulation results

=== Kolmogrov scales of turbulence energy turbulence ===
* The scale at which dissipation occurs is small-scale motions which is determined, statistically, by the molecular viscosity and energy dissipation
* Time scale of Kolmogrov comes from dividing the molecular viscosity by the dissipation rate, rooted
	- $t_n ~ \sqrt(\frac{\nu}{\epsilon})$
	- length of time where the small eddies revolve once
* Length scale is given by the Kolmogrov length scale (size of the dissipating eddies which transfer energy to viscous dissipation)
	- $\eta ~ (\frac{\nu}^4}{\epsilon})^(1/4)$

== Numerical modeling ==
* For course grid resolution, where the scales of the energy cascade aren't resolved, various turbulent dissipation models must be employed
* Direct numerical simulation (DNS) resolves every scale of turbulence
* Large eddy simulation (LES) resolves motion of the eddies in the inertial sub-range
* κ-ε model is a compromise when the resolution is too course for LES
