= Notes =
* turbulence in the boundary layer is chiefly important for _sediment transport_
== Laminar boundary layer (periodic flow) ==
* Make a distinction between time-periodic flows and wave-driven flows
* Solutions to the time-periodic flows (assuming a sum of period velocities; one representing free-steam and the other within the boundary layer) are a sum of free-steam and decaying velocity-deficit term
* Treat tidal-boundary layers as steady state (background) because the period is so large and the boundary layer thickness is so large
* A reversal of shear sign in the shear profile indicates large velocity gradients and the production of turbulence. This occurs during the return phase of a wave driven flow

== Asymmetric waves ==
* Asymmetric wave are important for equilibrium profiles
* Onshore bar migration is postulated to occur because of a skewness in the _acceleration_ profile
* Skewness and asymmetry are the same thing in statistics, but in coastal engineering, if there is skewness in the outer velocity, then the wave is considered asymmetric
* For skewed waves, the outer velocity is symmetric but the velocity is skewed
* Skewness affects the acceleration profile
	* equal to the third velocity central moment divided by the second moment to the 3/2
	* The numerator increases with skewness and the sign tells you
