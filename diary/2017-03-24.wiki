== Notes ==
* Comparison of NARR vs observed winds at a NOAA station by the Wax Lake delta.
	- The peaks look ok
	- NARR winds have a 32 km resolution

* Took for offset in modeled and observed and add this difference to the boundary conditions.
	- This is termed the sub-tidal signal
	- The model basically doesn't capture this phenomena

== TODO ==
1. [X] Look at changing the Courant number to smooth out the simulations of the 1D advection equation
2. [X] Look at implementing the new Janssen model
3. [X] One slide about the numerical scheme of wave action balance
4. [X] Finish TODO from [[diary:2017-03-17|last week]]
