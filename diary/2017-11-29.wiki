= Notes =
* Look into the alongshore wave boundary on XBeach. Can you have periodic instead of extending the domain? 
	* Look at Chen and Svendsen on this
* Look at RST boundary effects in order to determine the size of the buffer. This shouldn't be arbitrary
* look at berm and possibly increase resolution and keep attention on the sand bar migration
