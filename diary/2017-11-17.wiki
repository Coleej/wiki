= Notes =
* Just compare with AK's stations, WAVCIS, and Grand Isle, and LUMCON
* Turn off sediment transport
* Keep vegetation
* Keep online coupling
* Waves come earlier than surge, run model earlier
* D3D only allows output at grid nodes. Ke liu's mesh is too large
	* It can interpolate the water level, but not the waves
* For now, don't touch the mesh and just output at the closest nodes
	* Adjust domain to align with grid nodes
* Find more references for Caminada
	* USACE
	* Look at the references in the design reports
* Compare the long time retreat
