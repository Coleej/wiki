== Notes ==
* Is the jump in refinement in my grid ok?

== TODO ==
* [X] Make even simpler case.
* [X] Make a constant slope case along a longshore uniform beach.
* [X] Look at example grid from the tutorials.
	- McCall's domain has smoothly varying grid refinement. It also has a large extension of longshore uniform grid cells.
* [X] Run through Steve's Agave tutorial

=== SH ===
* Contact Karim Alisad for RTK measurements at next field visits.
* De-tide KH's model results from Four League Bay. Perform a harmonic analysis and determine which signals are well represented by the model.
* NARR data is not the best.
* Suggests that KH's model should go back to the hydrodynamics before moving on to the sediment transport.
* Should DeltaSEES have a special session at the next AGU meeting in New Orleans?
	- Contact the other DeltaSEES groups (China and India) for this?

=== KX ===
* The values of TSS (~50 mg/L) at the mouth of the bay is typical for these systems.
* The tidal channel TSS observation does not have the correct GPS location. It is more near the transition to the tidal flat.
* Max depth at T1 is ~1.6m.
* Suggest the KH run his model of Four League Bay for an energetic cold front.
* FFT analysis on turbidity signal and found that the dominate period is around 4 days.

=== RT ===
* The presence of snails on the marsh grass is a good indicator of recent flooding.
* Annabeth: Deploy the ISCO at the same time that the 26 hr survey across the mouth of the crab claw.
* Referenced a study that monitored marsh flooding for a year and didn't observe a single flood event in Four League Bay. 
	- Dan Chilldress did this work, attributed this low sea-level stand to El Nino and published a paper on this.

=== DE ===
* Suggests that KH's model should focus on basic hydro for a little while longer.

=== NL ===
* Contact a journal about creating a special issue.

1. [ ] Find Chilldress paper
