= Rules of thumb for drafting publication =
== Order of drafting sections ==
=== Regular form ===
1. Background
2. Methodology
3. Results
4. Discussion
	- loops back to results if more (results) are necessary
5. Conclusions

=== Alternate ===
* Conclusions first

== Notes ==
* Begin to target journals during latter stages of drafting

= Notes for CE7701 =
== Figures ==
1. Isolate phases to evaluate TKE
2. Do this for $\Phi = \frac{2\pi}{n}$
3. Time average at each phase
4. Plot $U_{avg}$ for a few phases (eg n = 8)

== Stationary checks ==
1. Check velocity through time
2. TKE (profile of velocity fluctuations) through time
3. Check new flux (phase averaged, depth integrated velocity) through time
	- Use the Chebyshev weight to integrate the phase and spatially averaged $u$
	- There will be fluctuations even once it reaches stationarity (depends of $Re_{\del}$) and probably a lot for my case
4. Check 2nd-order moments of quantities
