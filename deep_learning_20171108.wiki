*supervised learning* uses labeled data
*unsupervised learning* uses unlabeled data and the goal is categorization
*reinforcement learning* uses unlabeled data and the system receives feedback for its actions
*overfitting* occurs when the model fits well on the training data but poorly on test data
*batch* is a subset of the training data
*epoch* is one full training cycle on the training set. Going though all *batches* once is an *epoch*
*feature* is the data in N dimension
*activation function* is used to output the hypothesis given the weights and feature data
*deep neural network* has more than 1 hidden layer

= Notes =
* Deep learning is a subset of machine learning
* Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are part of deep learning neural networks (DNN)
* Cost function, $J(w), C, L$, is the machine learning (ML) term for the error function in statistical regression
	- Weights and biases $(w,b)$ correspond to parameters in regression
	- Minimizing the cost function may not lead to a _unique_ solution
* For the basic network the data is composed of a linear combination of the feature vector scaled by a weight vector and an threshold
* The data is passed to the activation function to output a hypothesis
* The type of function used as the activation function classifies the neurons in a network
