= Synopsis =
Data on the north Gulf of Mexico (NGOM) is presented which indicates:
	1. barrier islands can conserve mass during catastrophic hurricanes
	2. smaller hurricanes and TSs can promote rapid dune aggradation and can contribute sediment to the entire system
	3. cold fronts play critical role in post-storm adjustment
	4. barrier systems in the NGOM do not necessarily immediately enter a recovery phase

= Conclusions =
Besides the conclusions mention above, (5) it is stressed that bay-side erosion due to postfrontal wind/waves is a significant geomorphological driver in the NGOM. While all other portions of the barrier island studied showed some signs of recovery and some form of accretion, the back-barrier beach continued to lose sediment though out the entire monitoring period.

= Criticisms =
* The paper is somewhat unclear as to methods, specifically:
	* The study region
	* Survey methods
	* size, extent, uncertainty of resulting data set
	* How they analyzed the survey data as to regions of the island
* The authors make lots of suggestions as to what is causing what, but they don't present any statistical verification as to prove that what they are explaining (erosion/accretion trends of different regions of the island) are even significant in the first place
* They never explain some implications of conclusion (5) above. If the back-barrier continually erodes due to postfrontal forcing, how was the island formed at its current width? Was it never in a dynamic equilibrium? Is it inevitable that it will erode away completely?
* Not attention is payed to horizontal spatial variability and/or alongshore transport

= Notes =
* Hurricane Opal (1995), with Hₛ ≈ 8m and Tₚ = 14s onshore, caused only 5% net volume loss of sediment across profiles with observed overwash between -1.5m NGVD on the front and back-barrier
* "Results [of a monitoring program] ... presented here show that hurricanes and tropical storms can be both "constructive" and "destructive" on barrier _subenvironments_ with respect to their sediment budget (p.64)"
* "There is a growing body of literature linking net foreshore and backshore erosion of bayside beaches to cold front passage over the NGOM (p. 65)"
	* The shoreline was displaced 40m bayward, but mass was apparently conserved. However, 2 years after hurricane Opal, the bayside shoreline had eroded 20m (presumably, the material transported during hurricane Opal) due to waves generated by the post-frontal phases of cold fronts (p.69).
* "A common regional weather phenomenon accompanying the passage of cold fronts is the strong postfrontal northerly wind (p.72)"
	- [[file:images/cold_front_signal.png]]
	- Do to the sheltering effect of the barrier, they hypothesize that only the post-frontal winds/waves/currents affect the back-barrier and also the RSLR is not the main driver
* They present some evidence that wave-induced setup is responsible for offshore sediment transport from the back-barrier beach during cold fronts by correlating large waves with offshore flow in the BBL (p.74)
* Weaker hurricanes may rework sediment into the berm and relic overwash terraces, but accretion in the bay is short lived as postfrontal winds and waves typically result in its erosion and a net loss in the system (p.76)

== Methods ==
* The dune system was divided into 4 sections:
	1. Gulf beach - foredune to -1.5m NGVD
	2. dune - foredune to bay beach dune
	3. bay beach - dune to MLW
	4. bayside platform - MLW to -1.5m NGVD bayside
* The data is mostly comprised of pre- and post-storm topobathymetric surveys
* For uniformity, shoreline was defined as 0.08m MLW or 0.0m National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD)
* the monitoring period for Santa Rosa, FL was ~6 years with 25 surveys during that time
