== Notes from exam ==
* Where was the dune elevation and shoreline position defined as in the NOAA post-Isaac assessment report (Guy et al. 2013).
	- It could have been longshore drift which produced the western end erosion and eastern end accretion.
* What is the exact reasoning behind the poor results of Lindener et al. (2010) application of XBeach to Katrina's impact on the Chandeleur islands?
	- Did they miss the return flow?
* How will calibration/validation work?
	- Isaac and Gustav
	- Two or more sections of Caminada for a single storm?
* Can field data analysis produce a publication?
* What are the numerical experiments going to be?

=== TODO ===
1. [ ] Get a better understanding of SBeach
	- Why is it important to use XBeach instead of SBeach?
	- Why does data analysis not suffice for this study.
2. [X] Compile more detailed specific information from USGS's post-Isaac assessment.
3. [.] Get specific information on lidar data set error and accuracy
	* [X] Guy et al. (2013) -- 2012 lidar data set
	* [ ] Info for 2010 lidar data set
	* [ ] Info for 2006 lidar set
5. [o] Ground truth lidar data sets by comparing between elevations of some structure between data sets and compare with other data sources
	* [X] Initial QA/QC
	* [ ] Rigorous testing
7. [ ] Get wave/water level observations for Gustav and Isaac
