= Notes =
== General ==
* There was a low frequency of tropical storm impacts between the 1930s and 1950s
	- 9 cyclones (2 cat 2 hurricanes)

== Methods ==
=== Coastal classifications ===
* The coasts line is divided into 9 geomorphic zones. The Late LaFourche Delta comprises the [[Caminada Headlands]]
* The geomorphic zones are subdivided into shoreline reaches
	- The Late LaFourche Delta contains reaches 42 - 48
	- The [[Caminada Headlands]] are reach 45 (21.7 mi) and extended from [[Belle Pass]] to [[Caminada Pass]]

=== Historical storms ===
* All direct hits within 125 mi of Lake Charles (SW LA) and within 125 mi of New Orleans (SE LA) were recorded
* Hurricanes and tropical storms were recorded

=== Shorelines ===
USC&GC T-sheets (1880s, 1930s, and 1950s) and orthorectified imagery (1998 - 2012) was used to delineate shorelines

==== Orthoimagery ====
* The high-water mark (HWM) was used to determine the shoreline
	* This is the upper limit of average wave runup at high tide
	* Geographically corresponds to the berm crest
	* Probably not consistent with mean high-water as determined from tidal gauges
	* If this was complicated, then MHW at nearby tide gauges for the time of the imagery was used
	* If hardstructures marked  the shoreline, then they "_made consistent_" and held fixed through time
