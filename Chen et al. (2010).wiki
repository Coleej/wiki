= Synopsis = 
Waves from hurricane Gustav (2008) is hindcast with [[SWAN]] and [[ADCIRC]]. These are compared to Andrew Kennedy's gauges and is forced with a verified parametric hurricane wind model of [[Hu et al. (2010)]].

= Conclusions =


= Criticisms =


= Notes =
== General ==
* "Wave spectral comparisons show that the white-capping formulation of Westhuysen et al. (2007) generally outperforms the default formulation of Komen et al. (1984) in SWAN under hurricane conditions. (p.1)"
* "maximum wind waves occurring on the right side of the hurricane track and propagating in the direction parallel to the hurricane translation direction (p.1)"

== Methods ==
=== Hurricane model ===
* Winds come from H*wind data ([[Powell et al. (1998)]])
* Central pressure comes form Nation Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) best track data

=== SWAN ===
* resolution = [400m, 3000m]
