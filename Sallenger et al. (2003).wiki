= Synopsis = 
A comparison between the Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM) lidar survey system and GPS measurements are made.

= Conclusions =
The RMSE between over 40,000 points of comparison between the ATM and GPS units is â‰ˆ15 cm. = Criticisms =


= Notes =
* offsets ranged from -1 to 24 cm when comparing the ATM to the terrestrial surveys
* random error ranged from 8 to 19 cm including errors from the GPS units
