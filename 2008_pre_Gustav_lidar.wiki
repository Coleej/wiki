=== Morphology change between 2008 - 2010 ===
==== Import ====
1. Downloaded raster files from USGS
2. projected to utm15n with a resolution of 2m and using lanczos_f interpolation

==== Extract dune area ====
* This removes water surfaces and small areas
	1. remove all cells with elevation less than 0.297m (GI MHW NAVD88)
	2. remove all areas except the 5 major continous areas that constitute the coastline dune/beach areas

= Notes =
* The bare-earth data contains more points than the first-surface. This seems wrong
