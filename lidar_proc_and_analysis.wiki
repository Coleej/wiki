= Methods =
== Work Flow ==
1. Mask areas of insufficient lidar data
1. Classify unclassified lidar data with mcc (see [[lidar_classification#MCC]])
	- Use optimized mcc parameters derived from minimizing the error between the classified *bare-earth* data and approximately co-located RTK surveys
2. 

== Removing water points ==
1. remove all cells with elevation less than 0.297m (GI MHW NAVD88 2007 - 2011)
2. remove all areas except the 5 major continous areas that constitute the coastline dune/beach areas

== Correcting systematic errors ==
1. Use stable locations (roads, buildings, etc) to compute the offset between two or more lidar data sets or the lidar data and high-accuracy altimetric data.
2. Use the _median_ value of all the differences
