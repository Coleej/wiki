= Metadata =
== Acquisition ==
* collected on October 12th 2002 -- 20121012
* acquired with the ATM

== Raw lidar ==
=== QA/QC ===
* raw vertical uncertainty = ±15cm - interpolation, gridding, and projection introduce additional errors
* Comparison with GC points (small area) indicate δz = ± 15 - 20cm
* raw horizontal uncertainty = ±80cm

== Las points ==
=== CRS ===
* UTM 15n
* NAD83
* GRS80
* NAVD88 (GEOID12B)
	* 0.01m altitude resolution

= Notes =
* Produced as part of the USGS/NASA Airborne Lidar Assessment of Coastal Erosion (ALACE) Project
* No processing has been done. Vegetation and water surface returns are present in the data
