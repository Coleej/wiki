Profiles from a sandy beach and composite sand-gravel beach are compared. The profiles are are analyzed with [[empirical_orthogonal_function|EOF]] analysis for cross-shore zones of morphodynamic activity. Mean profiles are compared to the equilibrium profile of [[Dean (1977)]] (showing a 11% and 5% RMSE, for the sandy and composite beach respectfully). The [[empirical_orthogonal_function|EOF]] quantitatively showed the difference between the two beach types analyzed.
