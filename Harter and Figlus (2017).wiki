== Methods ==
=== Lidar data ===
* pre-storm lidar predates post-lidar by 2 years
* Any post-storm lidar data which showed a gain > 2m with the pre-storm lidar was eliminated as unrealistic accretion

=== Analysis ===
* Analyzed subaerial accretion/erosion patterns
	- Created a table with 5 columns where the rows are different times based on the Storm Impact Scale.
		* The erosion/accretion patterns were determined by taking the difference between the initial topography and that at the end of the time period. Positive changes were ID's as accretion, etc.
		* Column values
			- accretion volume (m³)
			- accretion rate (m³/hr)
			- volume eroded (m³)
			- erosion rate (m³/hr)
			- net volume change (m³)
		* Also analyzed individual profiles in the same way
* Visually compared post-simulation elevations to pre- and post-storm photography
* Computed the [[file:images/img01_harter.png|skill and bias]] of the model
	- This was only calculated where sub-aerial lidar data was available for both the pre- and post-storm
	- Any post-storm lidar data which showed a gain > 2m with the pre-storm lidar was eliminated as unrealistic accretion

== Model setup ==
=== Grid ===
* Rectilinear grid
* $Δx = 20m - 5m$
	- $20m$ in the offshore transitions to $5m$ near the dune to $20m$ in the back bay
* CFL = 0.7

=== Domain ===
alongshore ≈ 30 km
cross-shore ≈ 6 km

=== Bathymetry ===
* Dune line is approximately centered within the domain
* Back-barrier is complex and has elevation ≈ 0.5 m or less with a max of ≈ 1 m
* offshore depth ≈ -9 m NAVD88

== Results ==
skill = 0.35
bias = -0.06
