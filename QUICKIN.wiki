= Operations =
== Depth ==
=== Grid cell averaging ===
* The grid cell averaging, at a grid node, searches for samples in an area defined by the surrounding cells' centers and the mid-point of these cells' interfaces
	* See the [[file:images/grid_cell_avg_search_area.png|layout]]
	* This area is relative and can be adjusted in the settings
	* A minimum number of samples must be in the search area (default = 4)

=== Triangular interpolation ===
* Depends quadratically on the number of samples, so its best to limit an area to a polygon and work in patches
	- The boarders between the patches need special care
	- Delete the boarder area and re-interpolate with a larger polygon

= Notes =
* Make sure the _aspect ratio_, _orthogonality_, and _smoothness_ are within the requirements set by [[Delft3D]]
* If there are more points than cells, average the values over the cells before interpolating the more sparsely sampled areas
* The manual suggests first using _depth linear_ interpolation to construct a framework, then applying _internal diffusion_ to smooth out the areas in between
* Observational points are defined at the cell centers
