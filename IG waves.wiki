== General concept ==
Modulations in shear stress gradients, forced by variations in short wave heights (wind waves or swell waves) in wave groups, cause time varying set-up/set-down oscillations. These oscillations are the IG waves or long waves in the surfzone.

== Notes ==
* It has turned out the breaker point variation (ie the initiating point in the surfzone for large gradients in radiation stress) and wave height variation are a much stronger forcing on IG waves than nonlinear interaction of shorter waves.

=== Generation ===
* There appears to be two differing theories about the forcing.
	1. The surfzone is saturated and long wave forcing is proportional to $γhₓ$, where $γ$ is the depth-induced breaker index and $hₓ$ is the cross-shore slope. In this case the time-varying cross-shore location of breaking (break-point), which oscillates with the wave group, is responsible for generating sufficient forcing for long waves, because before the onset of breaking there is little gradient in radiation stress.
	2. Gradients in radiation stress are caused by groupiness and persist into the surfzone.
