=== Acquisition ===
* date: 2012-09-05 to 2012-10-11
* acquired Optech 3100 Serial 05SEN175 and Leica ALS70 SN716

=== QAQC ===
* The USGS ground truthed the aerial lidar data with ground surveys in a small area of the Chandeleur Islands. They also give the report of the contractors, but it is unclear how they relate to each other. They report this accuracy:
	- Reported by the USGS
		* RMSE of elevation = 0.072m
		* offset of elevation = 0.007m
	- Reported by Aero-Metric (lidar contractors hired by the USGS)
		- FVA = 0.245m
		- CVA = 0.363m
		- SVA = 0.363m
* A survey was also conducted on Dauphin Isle
	- RMSEz = 0.32m with an offset of 0.27m using 2
* The lidar data _are_ shifted by some unspecified amount using a program which searches the lidar points locations and finds the difference between that and the ground truthing control point.
	- Probably the offset for that area
