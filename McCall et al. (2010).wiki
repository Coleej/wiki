== Model setup ==
=== Grid ===
$Δx = 20m - 5m$
	- Offshore to the dune area and then is transitions to $~20m$ in the back-barrier 
$Δy = 60m - 40m$
	- The mesh transforms from $60m$ in the uniform domain to $40m$ in the area of interest
$n_x = 91$
$n_y = 177$
$n_{el} = 16107$

=== Time stepping ===
* average $Δt = 0.3s$

== Comparison ==
* The model results (generated with input bathymetry from May 2004) is compared to observed post-storm lidar data (Sept. 2005)
	- The comparison is limited to the sub-aerial portion of the post-storm lidar data
