= Synopsis = 
The primary purpose of this study is to document morphological impacts of extreme storms in the GoM and western Atlantic coasts. 6 - 7 hurricanes are compared with the observed overwash deposits that they have caused. Relationships between overwash and various extreme storm parameters are presented, but not conclusive relationships are drawn.

== General ==
* "Beyond this first approximation washover penetration depends on factors other than storm surge elevations. (p. 562)"

== Methods ==
* aerial photography is used to quantify washover extents and [[modes.]]
