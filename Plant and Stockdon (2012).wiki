= Notes =
* Defined dune crest change as the different in elevation of the dune and the location of the pre-storm dune crest instead of migrating to the position of the post-storm dune crest
	* See [[file:images/plant_2012_dune_scheme.png]]
		* Where η98 is the extreme run-up (Rhigh in [[Sallenger (2000)]])
		* η50 is the storm induced mean water level (Rlow in [[Sallenger (2000)]])
