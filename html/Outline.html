<div id="Outline-Theses"><h2 id="Theses">Theses</h2></div>
<ol>
<li>
Is there a minimum elevation for beach, dune, and back-barrier features (sand bar, berm, dune crest, and back-barrier marsh platform), or combination thereof, which promotes sediment retention? How does this minimum configuration vary with storm impact regime? What is our capacity to optimize a “minimum” design beach/dune profile for sediment retention?

<li>
How does the width, elevation, and biophysical characteristics (vegetation type, density, spatial configuration) of the back-barrier, relative to the back-barrier estuarine/lagoon surge levels, affect sediment retention during extreme storms?

<li>
What is the fate of newly-placed sediment (due to the restoration activity) after a storm impact? In other words, for a storm with given characteristics (trajectory, intensity, timing), is the relative proportion of sediment lost to the back-bay, alongshore sinks, and offshore approximately constant or does it vary with barrier island features that are within the capacity of engineering to alter?

<li>
Is the historical rate of placed sediments on Louisiana’s barrier islands sufficient to withstand erosion due to forecasted hurricanes, assuming that the hurricane return period remains constant but taking into account relative sea-level rise in the region.
