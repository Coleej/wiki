= Synopsis =
1D XBeach was run for a specific storm with 10 different cross shore profiles. The BSS score was calculated from the terrestrial part of the profile. The models showed the highest sensitivity to the _facua_ (parameter to control the effect of wave skewness and asymmetry on flow) parameter. 

= Conclusions =
The best BSS score for a set up parameters which yielded the highest *mean* BSS score was 0.7 for an individual profile.

The authors concluded that XBeach is capable of modeling storm induced beach/dune morphology change, _if a site-specific calibration is performed_.

= Notes =
== Methods ==
=== Lidar data ===
* Pre-storm surveying was approximately 2 months before the modeled storm.
	* terrestrial survey was done with geodetic methods.
		* vert. accuracy = ± 5cm and horz. accuracy = ± 10 cm
	* subaqueous survey was done with mutli-beam
		* vert. accuracy = ± 8 cm and horz. accuracy = ± 20 cm
* Post-storm surveying was done by LiDAR approximately 1 month after storm
	* ≤ 0.2 m vertical and horizontal accuracy

=== Analysis of results ===
* Calibration assessment tables of [[Brier skill scores]] (BSS) ([[file:images/BSS_vanRijn03.png|eqn]]) are computed for various combinations of input parameters of the range of modeled profiles
* Tables of volumetric changes over the modeled profiles for different setups are compared with the observed change
* Visual comparison between modeled and observed profile changes

== Model setup ==
* Best model scores were found with:
	* _hmin_= 0.01 or 0.05
	* _facua_ = 0.2 to 0.5
	* _wetslp_ = 0.2 to 0.4
	* _dryslp_ =  1 or 1.5
* Profiles near hard structures show a lower BSS.
	* This is probably due to the lack of alongshore information when XBeach is run in 1D.
