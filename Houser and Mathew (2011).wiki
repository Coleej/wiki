== General ==
* "Despite erosion of the beachface and backshore and a shoreline retreat of~27m, the foredune height increased over most of the study area and washover was limited to the pre-existing channels. (p.66)"

== Methods ==
=== Lidar ===
* 2 Lidar surveys 2000 and 2005
* Lidar was gridded and tiled with 50m buffer zone
	- 1m resolution
	- IDW interpolation
	- RMSE = 0.24 (2000) and 0.32m (2005)

=== Waves ===
* Used MIKE21 for waves
* "The shelf bathymetry fronting the barrier island is not uniform alongshore. Transverse ridges extend to the NNW (10°) or about 40° off the shoreline with an apparently regular spacing."
	- The bathymetry at Caminada seems more alongshore uniform


=== Analysis ===
* Cross-wavelet analysis with a complex Morlet mother wavelength ([[Torrence and COmpo (1998)]])
