== Formulas ==
*Reynolds' of the Stokes boundary layer*: $R_{\delta} = U^*_0 \frac{\sqrt{2\nu^*/\omega^*}}{\nu^*}$
	- $U^*_0$ and $\omega^*$ are the amplitude and frequency of the velocity oscillations far form the wall
	- $\nu^*$ is the kinematic viscosity of the flow

*Stokes boundary layer thickness*: $\delta = \sqrt{2\nu^*/\omega^*}$

== General ==
* [[Longuet-Higgins (1958)]] showed that a small amplitude wave propagating over a smooth bottom creates and onshore directed steady streaming flow.
	- The case for laminar flow and if the eddy viscosity is independent of time
	- Important for sediment transport in the nearshore
* Asymmetric waves have an offshore directed steady streaming due to asymmetry in the turbulent fluctuations during the on- and offshore directed phases
	- Important for sediment transport in the nearshore
	- Opposes the Longuet-Higgins streaming

=== Stokes' layer flow regimes ===
I. Small $R_\delta$
* Flow is laminar and described by the Stokes solution

II. $R_\delta > 100$
* small perturbations are observed but the flow remains similar to the Stokes solution

III. $R_\delta > 550$
* The flow is intermittently turbulent
* turbulent bursts appear during the decelerating phase
* significantly different from the stokes solution

IV. $R_\delta > 3500$
* fully turbulent with bursts throughout the entire cycle
