*Reynolds' of the Stokes boundary layer*: $R_{\delta} = U^*_0 \frac{\sqrt{2\nu^*/\omega^*}}{\nu^*}$
	- $U^*_0$ and $\omega^*$ are the amplitude and frequency of the velocity oscillations far form the wall
	- $\nu^*$ is the kinematic viscosity of the flow

*Stokes boundary layer thickness*: $\delta = \sqrt{2\nu^*/\omega^*}$
