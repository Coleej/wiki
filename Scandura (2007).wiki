== Formulas ==
*Reynolds' of the Stokes boundary layer*: $R_{\delta} = U^*_0 \frac{\sqrt{2\nu^*/\omega^*}}{\nu^*}$
	- $U^*_0$ and $\omega^*$ are the amplitude and frequency of the velocity oscillations far form the wall
	- $\nu^*$ is the kinematic viscosity of the flow

*Stokes boundary layer thickness*: $\delta = \sqrt{2\nu^*/\omega^*}$

*free stream orbital velocity*: $u^* = U_0^*cos(\omega^*t^*) + U_1^*cos(2\omega^*t^*)$ (2nd-order Stokes wave)

*wave asymmetry*: $u_r = \frac{U_1^*}{U_0^*}$
== General ==
* [[Longuet-Higgins (1958)]] showed that a small amplitude wave propagating over a smooth bottom creates and onshore directed steady streaming flow.
	- The case for laminar flow and if the eddy viscosity is independent of time
	- Important for sediment transport in the nearshore
* Asymmetric waves have an offshore directed steady streaming due to asymmetry in the turbulent fluctuations during the on- and offshore directed phases
	- Important for sediment transport in the nearshore
	- Opposes the Longuet-Higgins streaming
* "The above authors ([[Ribberink and Al-Salem (1995)]]) reported that, under asymmetric flow conditions, a net wave-averaged horizontal velocity was measured against the direction of the ‘wave propagation’, or in the direction of the flow during the trough half-cycle, which was about 4%of the time-dependent flow velocity. (p.267)"


=== Stokes' layer flow regimes ===
I. Small $R_\delta$
* Flow is laminar and described by the Stokes solution

II. $550 > R_\delta >= 100$
* small perturbations are observed but the flow remains similar to the Stokes solution

III. $3500 > R_\delta >= 550$
* The flow is intermittently turbulent
* turbulent bursts appear during the decelerating phase
* significantly different from the stokes solution

IV. $R_\delta > 3500$
* fully turbulent with bursts throughout the entire cycle
