= Synopsis = 
The paper examines how the definition of a dune feature drives the methodology used to extract dunes and to synthesize a comprehensive definition of dune features.

= Notes =
* Dune crest may be the _simplest_ definition: "highest elevation of the coastal primary sand dune"

== Methods ==
=== Dune feature interpretation ===
==== Manual delineation and interpretation (MDI) ====
* This is useful to begin more automated and objective feature extraction
	- Combine this with various mapcalc functions/mapping to facilitate the delineation
* May be the best method when performed by an expert in the area

==== Slope-infection point based (SIP) ====
* Defines features based on points of maximum curvatures and slope sign changes  in shore-normal 2D elevation profiles
	- They incorrectly call the slope sign change an _inflection point_
* This may be useful because these changes in slope are related to sediment transport and deposition

==== Least-cost path (LCP) ====

==== Relative relief ====
