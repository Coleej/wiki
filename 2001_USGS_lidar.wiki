== Acquisition ==
* date: 2001-09-09 to 2001-09-10
* Acquired with the ATM

== Raw lidar ==
=== QA/QC ===
* raw vertical uncertainty = ±15cm - interpolation, gridding, and projection introduce additional errors
* Comparison with GC points (small area) indicate δz = ± 15 - 20cm
* raw horizontal uncertainty = ±1m
* Areas with a more than 1.5 Secchi disc depths are marked "No Data"

== Las points ==
=== CRS ===
* UTM 15n
* NAD83
* GRS80
* NAVD88 (GEOID12B)
	* 0.01m altitude resolution

== Rasters ==
