= Notes =
* Lidar is _first-return_ and therefore contains bare-earth and vegetation elevations
	* While they could distinguish trees on the established dunes, they couldn't isolate the grasses found on the incipient dunes
* Pre-storm lidar was +5 months before Ivan (which occurred in September) and the post-storm was 2 months after
* Interpolation of raw lidar was done with TINs
* A road was used as a GC point between lidar surveys
