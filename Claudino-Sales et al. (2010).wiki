= Synopsis = 
Pre- and post-Ivan (2004) lidar surveys are compared to determine morphology changes at Santa Rosa Island, FL. The dunes here range from 2.5 to 8.0 m above MSL.

= Notes =
* Lidar is _first-return_ and therefore contains bare-earth and vegetation elevations
	* While they could distinguish trees on the established dunes, they couldn't isolate the grasses found on the incipient dunes
* Pre-storm lidar was +5 months before Ivan (which occurred in September) and the post-storm was 2 months after
* Interpolation of raw lidar was done with TINs
* A road was used as a GC point between lidar surveys
	- Average difference in elevation of the road pre- and post-storm was ≈15cm
	- Only profiles where the road elevation matched will before and after the storm are used for comparison
* The distance from the dune to the sea is identified a critical feature which influences dune survivability. Longer distance equals more of a chance to survive
* Four aspects of dune morphology contribute to dune survivability:
	- continuity of the dune ridge
		- They found that continuity might be a deciding factor in preserving dunes in contrast to their assertions in [[Claudino-Sales, Wang and Horwitz (2008)]]
	- cross-shore width of dune field
		- They point out that this might be a controlling factor but only use one example
	- dune height
		- This is also found to not be a major factor in survivability. But the examples they use have very steep foredune slopes and are narrow dunes
	- intradune wetlands
* Typical volumetric losses are quoted at 100 - 200 m³/m with washover deposition of 50 - 100 m³/m, resulting in net erosion
	- These figures lose their cogency because island width affects the severity of the erosion
	- Subaqueous washover deposition and alongshore transport are also posited as potential sinks in the sediment budget
