= Summary =
The commonly observed И-shaped long wave associated with short-wave forcing is explained by the _set-down_ wave of [[Longuet-Higgens and Stewart (1964)]] with a leading surge associated with the build-up of forcing as the wave group approaches the shore.

= Conclusion =
Qualitative evidence is offered that prior to the onset of breaking, a leading edge of the infragravity wave can be detected which is free-wave generated by the abrupt start of gradients in $Sxx$ associated with shoaling. This leading free-wave, in conjunction with the bowl-shaped _set-down_ wave, is responsible for the observed И-shaped wave.
