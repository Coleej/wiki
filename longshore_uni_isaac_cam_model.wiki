== Grid ==
* The minimum offshore grid spacing is approximately $Δx = 72m$
	- Uses a minimum of 12 points per [[IG waves|IG wave]] length
	- Based on a estimated short wave period of $T_m = 13s$
	- Assumes $T_{p,long} = 4 * T_{p,short} = 52s$ and that $n ≤ 0.8$ at the boundary
		* This would suggest that $Δt ≈ 5s$ will resolve the long waves
* [[XBeach]] computes the time-step given a CFL number (default = 0.7)
	- For the current model with $Δx ≈ 5m$ near the dunes, the $Δt ≤ 0.2$ to satisfy the default CFL number

== Depth ==
* Two strategies are attempted:
	1. The 2006 BICM single-beam data is excluded from the coverage of the 2010 terrestrial survey produced by CPRA, but it is retained elsewhere
		* These may either be directly interpolated or first grid cell-averaged first
	2. All of the data is included
		* These may either be directly interpolated or first grid cell-averaged first
