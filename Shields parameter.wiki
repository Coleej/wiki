A dimensionless [[shear stress]] defined as the ration between the fluid mechanical drag force and the sediment's submerged weight.

\tau_* = \theta = \frac{\tau_0}{(\gamma_s - \gamma_m)d_s}

* See the [[file:images/shields_curve.png|Shields curve]] which relates the threshold [[critical Shields parameter]] for the initiation of motion to [[Reynolds partical number]]
	- It is easier to work with the [[file:images/modified_shields_diagram.png|modified Shields diagram]] as the [[shear_velocity|shear velocity]] has been eliminated and replaced with a dimensionless grain size
	- The actual [[critical_shields_parameter|critical Shields parameter]] is hard to determine exactly because the measurement of the initiation of motion is subject, so there is a lot of scatter in the diagram, but it gives a good indication
