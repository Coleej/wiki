= White-capping =
== Concept ==
Wave breaking seems to be theoretically intractable at the moment. However, "the occurrence of white-capping is essential a property of the sea state itself, and obviously closely related to the wind (Holthuijsen, 2007)."

== Notes ==
* Constitutes a source term (for a single frequency component) in the [[Wave energy balance]] equation.
	- Its formulation is a matter of informed speculation but includes wave steepness.
