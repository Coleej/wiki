== FAST ==
* FAST-IE is used to get coastal bathymetry from satellite
	* The algorithm returns depth per pixel
	* Ground truthed in Europe and US (Wax Lake Delta)
* FAST-Veg is a component that estimates vegetation cover remotely
	* Sentinel-2
	* Uses the Vegetation index (NDVI)
	* Returns a vegetation presence map
	* Has been used to map seasonal vegetation dynamics
	* Has been used to derive [[Leaf Area Index]] (LAI)

=== Ground truthing ===
==== Field measurements ====
* What are the import parameters?
	* What affects waves and water levels
	* What attributes affect stability
	* What is remotely measurable from space
	* Examples
		* High ground, vegetation, rough surface, and high water and low water
* Surface attribute variability
* Measured attributes
	- incoming/reflected radiation - spectral response
		- Used handheld spectrometers to ground truth the satellite data
		- Compared measured vs theoretical spectra for such things as wet/dry vegetation
			- Deviations from theoretical spectra were used to derive properties of the vegetation
			- deviations also used to look at seasonal variations
		- One plot showed good agreement between field and the satellite measurements
	- vegetation
		- biomass
			- Used UAVs
		- structure
			- Used _side-on photography_ to assess structure
	- sediment/topography
		- elevation
			- Used UAVs
		- grain size
		- features
		- roughness
			- some sort of novel measurement technique
		- OM
		- tidal bed dynamics
		- long term sediment erosion/deposition
	- Water elevation and waves
		- recorded with 4 Hz
		- Also measured topography with RTK units in the zones important to waves
		- Timed wave measurements for when the marsh is flooded (the unit starts a burst when the tide is rising)
* Field campaign
	* Extremely shallow environments
		* No boat access
		* No foot access
		* necessitated flexibility of sample locations
	* Shore normal and parallel transects
* Derived products
	* Lidar derived margin categories (cliff, marsh, etc)

== Data-model integration ==
=== General ===
* An attempt to do this globally
* In the browser, the XBeach results were pre-computed and are selected based on user input
* Uses water levels and wave height of a 10-year return period
* No wave growth on the foreshore XBeach domain
	* The boundaries are imposed from the global data sets for water levels and Hm0

=== XBeach ===
==== Model inputs ====
* Topography sources: SRTM and GEBCO
	* The constructed some derived product to combine the multiple maps
* vegetation: GlobCover 2009
* hydrodynamic:
	* Muis et al. (2016)
	* ERA-Interim for Hm0 and Tp
 
==== Veg module ====
* non-hydrostatic mode
	* Includes drag force in momentum equation
* surf-beat mode
	* Mendez and Losada for short waves
	* drag force in momentum equations for long waves
* look at Van Rooijen et al. (2015, 2016) for details of model implementation

== MI-SAFE system infrastructure ==
* They have a user portal for MI-SAFE with a GUI
* They have a metadata portal which serves: Geotiffs, NetCDF, and Insitu files
