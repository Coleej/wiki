Dr. Chen's presentation [[file:~/Documents/Meetings/DeltaSEES/1-6-2016/site_characteristics.pdf]]

_Flood Risk_ definition:
$ risk = consequence * probability $

First visit to "Crab Claw" in late January.

James Morris: March 30th.

Schedule of meetings will be decided in future but will likely be the first friday of Feb.

= Minutes =
Broken down by contributions by each PI.

== SH ==
* Not ready to work on flood induced risk for 1980 or 1990 because the model is not ready.
* Need to define flood _exposure_ before passing data to NL.
* What storms should be ran through the model?
	- Choose retired names (Katrina, Rita, etc.
	- The pre-1970 and pre-1950 and pre-1900 storms have very little data available.
	- A qualitative difference exists between developing wind field from old versus recent wind fields.
* What is the appropriate hydrological output to feed to the sociological model?
	- Max flood depth, average flood depth, etc.?
* SH can an produce FEMA flood maps (synthetic, not real, storm surges).
	- Can provide data by polygons but HUC polys are best to use.
	- HUCs will guide the historical storm surge simulation runs.

== NL ==
* Is there a set of input parameters for social modeling from SH's currently developed model for 1980 or 1990.
* Needs more *data*. Currently only has 4-5 points per parish.
* Ready to work with 2010 data from SH.

== SB ==
* Maybe we should not be working on nuisance flooding at the moment.

== RT ==
* The proposal states that we are trying to calibrate perception of risk due to landscape change.
* This should be considered when choosing which storms to model.
* Need a temporal resolution on the order of 30 years (1980, 1990, 2000 may be too fine).
* dt should be ~30 years. As stated in the proposal.
* Probability in the vein of FEMA maps are for forecasting risk, however for the project we shouldn't think this way.
	- We should focus on something like drivers in ecological studies should be considered. Determine the cause and effect relationship between flooding and population dynamics.

= Action Items =
[ ] SH and Chris will determine available wind fields for historical storms.
