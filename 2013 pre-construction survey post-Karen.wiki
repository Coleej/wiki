= Summary =
After tropical storm Karen, STA 140+00 eastward to STA 315+00 were re-surveyed. The amount of erosion was estimated as 80,700 CY. This was deemed comparably minimal to other storm induced erosion (the total fill template was adjusted upwards to 2,685,100 CY). Re-design was therefore not necessary.
