= Notes =
* The authors speculate that [[XBeach]] is artificially producing a flatter surfzone than exists in nature. Thus, the swash dynamics are not being captured by the wetting/drying scheme as they usually do for milder sloping dune/beaches.
* Reproducing the same Monte Carlo probability model as was used for the analytic (< 1 hr) and SBeach (40 days) erosion function was estimated to take 4 and ½ millennia to complete.

== Model setup ==
=== Grid ===
* 1D model
* $Δx = 2m$ in the surfzone and $17m$ further offshore

=== Parameters ===
* Chézy's coefficient = $65m½/s$
* set a d50 and a d95
* calibration:
	* critical slopes = 0.6 (dry) and 0.3 (wet
	* breaking formulation = [[Roelvink (1993)]]
	* include/exclude rollers = include
	* hmin = 0.05m
	* hswitchx = 0.1m
	* facAs = 0.25

=== Physics ===
* used Soulsby-Van Rijn equation for sediment transport 
* Used PM spectrum to force short-wave BC
