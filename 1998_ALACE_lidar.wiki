= Metadata =
== Acquisition ==
* Dates: 1998-10-29 to 1998-11-09
* Acquired with the ATM II

== Raw lidar ==
=== processing ===
* Metadata indicates that its unprocessed lidar returns containing vegetation and water surfaces
* The data were visually cleaned "by eye"
* Points withing a pre-defined radius which differed more than 2σ from the mean were tossed out as outliers

=== QA/QC ===
* raw vertical uncertainty = ±15cm
* raw horizontal uncertainty = ±80cm
* Comparison with GC points (small area) indicate δz = ± 15 - 20cm

== Las points ==
=== CRS ===
* UTM 15n
* NAD83
* GRS80
* NAVD88 (GEOID12B)
	* 0.01m altitude resolution

== Raster ==
* Δx = 3m
* UTM 15n

* part of the Gulf Coast NOAA/USGS/NASA Airborne LiDAR Assessment of Coastal Erosion (ALACE) Project for the US Coastline project

= Work =
== Central subregion ==
* Lidar was classified with the [[lidar_classification#MCC|mcc]] algorithm
	- resolution (res) = 0.5 m
	- tension (t) = 0.2
	- spline step (s) = 20
