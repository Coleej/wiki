= Regularized spline with tension (rst) =
* A very general interpolation method
	* Can be tuned to weight the influence of distance between points similar to _kriging_ and _inverse distance weighting_

== Tension parameter ==
* The tension parameter determines the influence of distance between points
	* High tension shortens the range of influence of each point
		* The surface goes rapidly to trend (ie the line between two points)
		* Stretches the interpolated surface over every point like a rubber sheet
	* Low tension increases range of influence
		* Smoother surfaces
		* Introduces the possibility of overshoots
			* To reduce over shoots combine low tension interpolation with *smoothing* parameters
* If creating a surface from contours, high tension will introduce waves where the contours form crests

== Smoothing parameter ==
* *Smoothing* relaxes how close the interpolation must be to a given point
	* This is introduced to correct low tension interpolations which still have to intersect a given data point and as a result cannot curve fast enough. Therefor large over shoot errors are introduced
	* High smoothing allows the surface to be farther from a given data point
* It is possible to set spatially varying smoothing parameters
	* Set low smoothing in areas of accurate data and higher smoothing where the accuracy is lower

== Anisotropic data ==
* This should be applied to most linear features
* Often applied to geological data which have been formed by wind or water
	* The anisotropy has to do with the relationship the direction has on the relationship between points, no the overall footprint of your data
		* For an alongshore uniform beach, the more import direction is cross-shore, not alongshore. 
* Allows from different tension parameters based on direction
