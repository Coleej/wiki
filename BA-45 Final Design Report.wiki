== Notes ==
* Find wave return period stats based on WIS on pg. 3-6
	- 100 yr storm (Hs = 33.1 ft, Tp = 14.6 s)
* Depth of closure determined from literature review (USACE (2004) and SJB and CEC (2005))
	* -3.4 to -4.6 m NAVD88 
	* -3.66 m NAVD88
* Depth of closure determined from empirical relationships
	* -6.8 m NAVD88 (Hallermeier, 1981)
	* -5.2 m NAVD88 (Birkemeier, 1985)
* Depth of closure based on sand/clay interface in seaward direction (OSI, 2010)
	* highly spatially variable
	* See [[file:/home/cjohnson/Documents/Maps/BA-45_Cam_Report_sand-clay_interface.pdf|Map]]
* Depth of closure used in design: -4.575 m NAVD88
