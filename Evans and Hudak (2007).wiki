* The MCC algorithm was design to be used in heavily forested errors and retain the vegetation canopy.
	- If vegetation canopy is not important, then block minimums may be sufficient
	- Thus _omission_ errors (where valid ground points are discarded) may not be such a bad thing where vegetation is not import
* The RMSE error between interpolated DEMs and ground control points:
	* GPS field plots:
		* St. Joe = 0.4100 m (n=81)
		* Moscow Mt. = 1.7655 m (n=84)
	* NGS monuments:
		* St. Joe = 0.2390 m (n=21)
		* Moscow Mt. = 0.9470 m (n=18)
