= Reviewed publications =
* [[Passeri et al. (2015)]]

= Notes =
== General ==
* Very broad and nondescript introduction
* Simple statements on processes which are cited
* Explanation of elementary concepts with high-level conceptual language
* 25 year old citations are present
* Conceptual description of relevant processes is broad and intermingled with tangential comments on importance
* The width of the subject should be covered and cited, but the details do not need individual treatment (just quote relevant stats)
* Its okay to state the obvious (ie the obvious to someone vested in the subject), no need to impress anyone

== Structure ==
* The paper should focus on sandy coasts, thus eliminating XBeach-G works
* Divide the sections into coastal relief (or modeled hydrodynamic processes, eg hurricane vs regular storm?)
